## Key Mandatory Processes for Space Travel Insurance

### Process 1: Client Qualification Assessment

The client qualification process serves as the foundation for all space travel insurance policies. Agents must conduct three essential assessments:

**Medical Assessment:** Clients must undergo specialized aerospace medical evaluation that examines cardiovascular response to microgravity, bone density measurements, and vestibular system sensitivity. These assessments must be conducted by our partnered aerospace medicine specialists and documented in our system.

**Psychological Evaluation:** Our standardized Space Psychology Assessment Protocol (SPAP) evaluates isolation tolerance, group dynamics compatibility, and stress response patterns. Clients for missions exceeding 30 days require additional psychological profiling focused on long-term isolation effects. All evaluations must be completed by certified examiners with results properly documented.

**Mission-Specific Qualification:** Agents must analyze the technical parameters of the client's intended space activity and match these with appropriate risk measures. For example, Lunar Gateway participants require assessment of radiation exposure limits and emergency evacuation readiness, while suborbital flight participants need evaluation of acceleration tolerance and emergency procedure comprehension.

All qualification documentation must be completed 90 days before mission launch and maintained for fifteen years post-mission. This process isn't about exclusion but about crafting precisely tailored protection based on scientific assessment of client-specific risks.

### Process 2: Product Alignment and Coverage Configuration

Once qualified, clients must be matched with appropriate insurance products through a structured process:

**Mission Risk Profile (MRP):** Agents must develop a detailed profile identifying at least fifteen specific risk factors associated with the client's space activity. For SpaceX Fram2 participants, this includes risks related to experimental procedures, EVA activities, and scientific equipment interaction. The MRP must be cross-referenced with our Comprehensive Risk Database.

**Coverage Configuration Session:** Agents must formally present appropriate coverage options addressing four categories: personal injury/medical response, equipment/vessel damage, mission failure contingencies, and third-party liability. Each category requires concrete examples of how coverage would respond to mission-specific scenarios.

**Documentation and Pricing Transparency:** Throughout this process, agents must maintain detailed notes in our system and generate a Coverage Alignment Summary for client acknowledgment. The process concludes with a Premium Calculation Report that clearly illustrates how each coverage component contributes to the overall price.

### Process 3: Informed Consent and Legal Documentation

This final process transforms technical understandings into binding legal agreements:

**Disclosure Package:** Agents must prepare comprehensive documentation including the Policy Document, Space Travel Risk Compendium, and Claims Procedure Manual specifically tailored to the client's mission.

**Formal Review Session:** A minimum two-hour session must be conducted where agents verbally explain each major policy section, explicitly discussing mortality statistics, accident scenarios, and health risks specific to the mission profile. Clients must confirm understanding after each section.

**Authentication and Specialized Documentation:** All documents require proper witnessing through notarization or our certified digital system. Clients must initial each page of risk disclosures. Missions involving experimental procedures require additional consent documentation with separate signatures.

All legal documentation must be completed 45 days prior to launch. The informed consent process is not merely a legal formality but a crucial educational opportunity ensuring clients truly understand their risks and protections.

### Implementation Requirements

These three processes must be implemented sequentially and completely, without abbreviation. Compliance is monitored through our Celestial Process Audit System, with monthly reports for each agent.

These mandatory processes ensure we provide innovative protection while maintaining the highest ethical and legal standards in space travel insurance.
